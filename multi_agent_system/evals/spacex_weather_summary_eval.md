# Evaluation: SpaceX Launch, Weather, and Summary

This document evaluates the multi-agent system's ability to handle the primary example goal: "Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather at that location, then summarize if it may be delayed."

## 1. User Goal

**Goal:** "Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather at that location, then summarize if it may be delayed."

## 2. Expected Agent Trajectory

The `Planner` agent is expected to parse the goal and determine the following sequence of agent executions:

1.  **`SpaceXAgent`**: To fetch details of the next SpaceX launch, including location coordinates.
2.  **`WeatherAgent`**: To fetch current weather conditions at the launch location provided by `SpaceXAgent`.
3.  **`SummaryAgent`**: To consolidate the information from the previous agents and provide a human-readable summary, including a potential delay assessment.

## 3. Expected Data Enrichment

Below is the expected state of the data dictionary as it's passed through the system. `(Actual values will vary based on real-time API responses.)`

### Initial Data (Input to Planner)
```json
{}
```

### After `SpaceXAgent` Execution
The data dictionary should be enriched with SpaceX launch details.
```json
{
  "spacex_mission_name": "Example Mission Name", // e.g., Starlink Group X-Y
  "spacex_launch_date_utc": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ", // e.g., 2023-12-01T10:00:00Z
  "spacex_rocket_name": "Rocket ID: <actual_rocket_id>", // e.g., Rocket ID: 5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec
  "spacex_launch_site_name": "Example Launch Site", // e.g., Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40
  "spacex_launch_pad_latitude": 28.56194122, // Example latitude
  "spacex_launch_pad_longitude": -80.57735635, // Example longitude
  "spacex_agent_status": "Success"
  // ... other potential internal fields from the agent ...
}
```

### After `WeatherAgent` Execution
The dictionary now includes weather data for the launch location.
```json
{
  "spacex_mission_name": "Example Mission Name",
  "spacex_launch_date_utc": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "spacex_rocket_name": "Rocket ID: <actual_rocket_id>",
  "spacex_launch_site_name": "Example Launch Site",
  "spacex_launch_pad_latitude": 28.56194122,
  "spacex_launch_pad_longitude": -80.57735635,
  "spacex_agent_status": "Success",
  "weather_conditions": "Example Weather Conditions", // e.g., "scattered clouds"
  "weather_temperature_celsius": 25.0, // Example temperature
  "weather_humidity_percent": 70, // Example humidity
  "weather_wind_speed_mps": 5.0, // Example wind speed
  "weather_rain_1h_mm": 0.0, // Example rain volume
  "weather_agent_status": "Success"
  // ... other potential internal fields ...
}
```

### After `SummaryAgent` Execution (Final Output from Planner)
The dictionary is further enriched with the summary text.
```json
{
  "spacex_mission_name": "Example Mission Name",
  "spacex_launch_date_utc": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  // ... all previous spacex and weather fields ...
  "weather_agent_status": "Success",
  "summary_text": "The next SpaceX mission, 'Example Mission Name', is scheduled to launch the Rocket ID: <actual_rocket_id> from Example Launch Site on YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. Current weather at the launch site: Example Weather Conditions, with a temperature of 25.0Â°C and wind speeds of 5.0 m/s. There has been 0.0mm of rain in the last hour. No immediate weather concerns for delay noted.", // Example summary
  "summary_agent_status": "Success",
  "status": "success" // Overall planner status
}
```

## 4. Actual Output

To obtain the actual output:
1.  Ensure the system is set up as per the `README.md` (virtual environment, dependencies, valid `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in `.env`).
2.  Run the main script from the `multi_agent_system` directory:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  The full JSON output will be printed to the console, followed by the extracted summary text.

**(Note: As an AI model, I cannot execute the script to generate this output. This section would be filled in by the user/developer running the code.)**

## 5. Goal Satisfaction Assessment

The goal is considered satisfied if:

1.  **Correct Agent Trajectory:** The `Planner` correctly identifies and executes the sequence: `SpaceXAgent` -> `WeatherAgent` -> `SummaryAgent`. This can be verified by observing the console output from `main.py` and `planner.py` (which print the agent sequence and execution steps).
2.  **Data Enrichment:** Each agent successfully fetches and adds its specific information to the data dictionary, as outlined in the "Expected Data Enrichment" section.
    *   `SpaceXAgent` provides valid launch name, date, rocket info, site name, and coordinates.
    *   `WeatherAgent` provides relevant weather conditions (description, temperature, humidity, wind, rain) for the coordinates supplied by `SpaceXAgent`.
    *   `SummaryAgent` generates a coherent `summary_text`.
3.  **Accurate Summary:** The `summary_text` correctly reflects the data fetched by the `SpaceXAgent` and `WeatherAgent`.
4.  **Plausible Delay Assessment:** The summary includes a reasonable assessment of potential weather-related launch delays based on the fetched weather data (e.g., mentioning high winds or heavy rain if present).
5.  **Error Handling:** If any agent encounters an issue (e.g., API error, missing data), it should be handled gracefully, and the status fields (`*_agent_status`, `status` in the final output) should reflect the problem. The system should not crash.

By comparing the "Actual Output" (when generated) against these criteria, the satisfaction of the user goal can be determined.
